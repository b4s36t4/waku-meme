# Waku Meme board.

A Vite project bootstrapped with React & Typescript.

This project contains code the bounty challenge by @waku-org.

In this project I have leveraged the Decentralized communication solution `waku` and a IPFS service `pinata`.

You can easily upload/download memes shared by others, fully decentralized fully open. No authentication need or so ever.
